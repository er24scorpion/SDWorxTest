# Test

 Build an API that would be able to receive data from an external source
- Use a message queue (any memory queue will do)
- Have a message producer and a message consumer
- Database stores and extraction
- Add as much as possible from the following list: exception handling, logging, throttling, implementing design patterns such as injection pattern, repository pattern, reflection pattern and whatever you think would be useful or good practice when developing such components
- Make sure all the components are independently injectable.
